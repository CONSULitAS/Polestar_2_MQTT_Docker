# Polestar_2_MQTT_Docker
Docker Container with Gateway between Polestar API and MQTT

Credits to Niklas Vieth (@hniklasvieth) for the great work on the Polestar SoC iOS Medium Widget (https://github.com/niklasvieth/polestar-ios-medium-widget).

This Software is based on this work and partly made with ChatGPT 4.0.

The initial Prompt for ChatGPT was taken from @demichve on the German Polestar Forum (https://polestar.fans/t/soc-medium-homescreen-widget-ios/17121/41?u=consulitas). Just because this was currently running on my phone. :-)

If ChatGPT has been involved in development steps here, this will be shorn in the comments to corresponding commits in this repository.

Heads up: This is work in progress, but now usable. Pull-Requests welcome!
